The original concept was made with a Giraffe as a playable character. This has been changed to a Kraken being, with the Giraffe's neck representing a tentacle.<br/>

## Pitch
You play as a ~~Giraffe~~ Divine being, having to eat entities in order to grow the max length of your tentacle.
The growth will be significant, reaching far into the sky and eventually in space where you need to eat cosmic constructions like other planets in order to keep growing your body.
- Evade projectiles
- Grow by eating anything in your path
You start off small as a single cell organism, eventually growing to cosmic sizes.

## Audience
~~Game's for all ages, and has a comedic, lightheaded theme.~~
The game will contain gore as objects & entities are consumed.
## Concept
### Gameplay Overview
~~The Giraffe is standing in one place.
You can control the head with the mouse, where the mouse goes is where the head tries to go.
The neck can only stretch to a particular length.
Navigate the head to bushes/trees with the mouse to eat the leaves and to grow the neck, it takes some time to fully eat the leaves, only on completion the neck will grow.<br/>~~
The Kraken's mouth stays on the bottom of the screen.
You can control one of its tentacles with the mouse, where the mouse goes is; where the tentacle tries to go.
The tentacle can only stretch to a particular length.
Navigate the tentacle to entities with the mouse to grab hold of it, drag it back to the central mouth to consume the entity and grow in size/length.

### GMTK theme
The theme: **Built to Scale**
~~Build up the Giraffe to scale its neck. It will be incredibly tall later on maybe even looping around space/time to get back to the original starting position.~~
Grow the kraken to cosmic scale by devouring everything it comes across. Maybe even looping around space/time to get back to the original starting position.
### Game Mechanics
#### Primary
##### Entities
Navigate the tentacle to an entity and grab hold of it to drag it back to the central mouth to consume it. There are multiple types of entities
###### Static Entities
Static entities consist of:
- Blood cells
- Ants
- Houses/ trees/ flats / buildings
- Planets
- Solar systems
None of them can attack or defend themselves, but are there to be grow quicker.
###### Dangerous Entities
Dangerous entities consist of:
- White blood cells (fighters)
- Birds
- Planes/Helicopters
- Comets
- Gods/Celestial beings?

Such entities can attack with projectiles

- Birds will fly over and dump their 'droppings' above the player's tentacle.
- Planes, same as birds will also shoot forward, requiring more skill to evade.
- Helicopters may hover in place and shoot directly at the tentacle
- Comets will randomly appear from different angles

These kinds of projectiles can't be devoured
Problem:
- How to split eatable entities from projectiles?
- Comets are both entities and projectiles

Solutions:
- Entities & Projectiles damage the main mouth piece instead of the tentacle, you must quickly act and eat the entities/projectiles before they hit the mouth piece. 
##### Stages
- Cell stage
	- Blood cells
	- White blood cells
- Grass/bug stage???
	- Flies
	- ants
	- Birds?
	- Grasses
- Civ stage
	- Houses/ Buildings
	- Birds
	- Airplanes
	- Helicopters
- Star system stage (combine with Galaxy stage?)
	- Planets
	- Comets
	- Ufos
- Galaxy stage
	- Galaxies
	- Dyson spheres
	- Black holes
- Celestial Stage
	- Gods
- Cell stage -> wraps back to beginning
##### Foliage / Trees / Leaves / Grassy planets
Eat foliage to grow the max stretch of the neck.
This can be done with trees, floating leaves, defeating enemies drop leaves??? But also, in deep space you will be able to eat other grassy planets.
Foliage can be destroyed by spit if not careful
##### Birds / Planes / Comets
Will sometimes fly across the screen.
- Birds: horizontal, will do its 'droppings' as soon as the giraffe's head is below the bird from a certain distance.
- Planes: Same as birds will show up in higher altitudes. Droppings are bombs/packets
- Comets: Will approach from different angles, does not do droppings.
##### Spitting
The giraffe can spit at a particular interval to defeat projectiles.
- Defeats all projectiles, may need multiple hits like planes/ ufo's comets...
- Don't shoot sporadically you may destroy leaves/trees/foliage
- Comets will explode into smaller rocks once spit on?
##### Neck stretching
The more foliage you eat the longer the max stretch is of the neck.
Taking damage will lower the max stretch

#### Secondary
##### Upgrades?
Get to choose offense/defence upgrades?
##### Bosses?
On certain altitudes bosses may appear, being defeated will lower you to a previous altitude
## Art
~~Cartoonish?~~
Retro Flash game style?
### Other Themes
You play as a tentacle monster/god and control a tentacle. Instead of eating leaves, you need to grab and pull entities out of the air and drag them back to a mouth on the bottom of the screen in order to grow.

- Pros:
	- Less silly concept, maybe
	- Food is not restricted to leaves/foliage
	- Growing to eventually eat the cosmos/multiverse is cooler with a divine being
	- No longer a kids game
	- <u>**We can start the game on an even smaller scale: cellular scale**</u>
- Cons:
	- If you need to consume things, shooting things down may not work in your favour.
		- Remove the ability to shoot?
	- ~~Because you don't have to stand still on foliage with the mouse to consume it, evading might be easier?~~
		- This could be a non-issue because your food could attack you
