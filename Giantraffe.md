## Pitch
You play as a Giraffe, having to eat leaves in order to grow the max length of your neck.
The growth will be significant, reaching far into the sky and eventually in space where you need to eat greens from other planets in order to keep growing your neck.
- Evade projectiles
- Defend yourself by spitting

## Audience
Game's for all ages, and has a comedic, lightheaded theme.
## Concept
### Gameplay Overview
The Giraffe is standing in one place.
You can control the head with the mouse, where the mouse goes is where the head tries to go.
The neck can only stretch to a particular length.
Navigate the head to bushes/trees with the mouse to eat the leaves and to grow the neck, it takes some time to fully eat the leaves, only on completion the neck will grow.

### GMTK theme
The theme: **Built to Scale**
Build up the Giraffe to scale its neck. It will be incredibly tall later on maybe even looping around space/time to get back to the original starting position.
### Game Mechanics
#### Primary
##### Foliage / Trees / Leaves / Grassy planets
Eat foliage to grow the max stretch of the neck.
This can be done with trees, floating leaves, defeating enemies drop leaves??? But also, in deep space you will be able to eat other grassy planets.
Foliage can be destroyed by spit if not careful
##### Birds / Planes / Comets
Will sometimes fly across the screen.
- Birds: horizontal, will do its 'droppings' as soon as the giraffe's head is below the bird from a certain distance.
- Planes: Same as birds will show up in higher altitudes. Droppings are bombs/packets
- Comets: Will approach from different angles, does not do droppings.
##### Spitting
The giraffe can spit at a particular interval to defeat projectiles.
- Defeats all projectiles, may need multiple hits like planes/ ufo's comets...
- Don't shoot sporadically you may destroy leaves/trees/foliage
- Comets will explode into smaller rocks once spit on?
##### Neck stretching
The more foliage you eat the longer the max stretch is of the neck.
Taking damage will lower the max stretch

On certain altitudes bosses may appear, being defeated will lower you to a previous altitude
