## Pitch
You play as a kraken, having to eat entities in order to grow the max length of your body.
The growth will be significant, reaching far into the sky and eventually in space where you need to eat cosmic constructions like other planets in order to keep growing your body.
You need to grab and pull entities out of the air and drag them back to a mouth on the bottom of the screen in order to grow.
- Evade projectiles
- Grow by eating anything in your path
You start off small as a single cell organism, eventually growing to cosmic sizes.

## Audience
The game will contain gore as objects & entities are consumed.

## Concept
### Gameplay Overview
The Kraken's mouth stays on the bottom of the screen.
You can control one of its tentacles with the mouse, where the mouse goes is; where the tentacle tries to go.
The tentacle can only reach what's visible on screen.
Navigate the tentacle to entities with the mouse to grab hold of it, drag it back to the central mouth to consume the entity and grow in size/length.

### GMTK theme
The theme: **Built to Scale**
Grow the kraken to cosmic scale by devouring everything it comes across. Maybe even looping around space/time to get back to the original starting position.
### Game Mechanics
#### Primary
##### Entities
Navigate the tentacle to an entity and grab hold of it to drag it back to the central mouth to consume it. There are multiple types of entities.
###### Static Entities
Static entities consist of:
- Blood cells
- Ants
- Houses/ trees/ flats / buildings
- Planets
- Solar systems
None of them can attack or defend themselves, but are there to allow quicker growth. Some of them may try to get away.
###### Dangerous Entities
Dangerous entities consist of:
- White blood cells (fighters)
- Birds
- Planes/Helicopters
- ~~Comets~~
	- Comets will become non-dangerous entities
	- Use UFOs instead as enemies in space
- Gods/Celestial beings?

Such entities can attack with projectiles

- Birds will fly over and dump their 'droppings' above the player's tentacle.
- Planes, same as birds will also shoot forward, requiring more skill to evade.
- Helicopters may hover in place and shoot directly at the tentacle
- Comets will randomly appear from different angles

#todo
These kinds of projectiles can't be devoured;
Problems:
- How to split eatable entities from projectiles?
- Comets are both entities and projectiles
- Can the tentacle get hurt from the projectiles, or only the mouth piece?

Solutions:
- Projectiles damage the main mouth piece instead of the tentacle, it could drag/**slap** away projectiles from the mouth piece.

##### Stages
Stages of the game (Levels)
- Cell stage
	- Blood cells
		- Only float around (like comets, random angles)
	- White blood cells
		- Slow moving with slow moving dropping projectiles
- Grass/bug stage???
	- Flies
	- ants
	- Birds?
	- Grasses
- Civ stage
	- Houses/ Buildings
	- Birds
	- Airplanes
	- Helicopters
- Star system stage (combine with Galaxy stage?)
	- Planets
	- Comets
	- Ufos
- Galaxy stage
	- Galaxies
	- Dyson spheres
	- Black holes
- Celestial Stage
	- Gods
- Cell stage -> wraps back to beginning
##### Eatable entities
Grab hold, and eat entities in order to grow in size.
##### Eatable dangerous entities
Will sometimes fly across the screen.
- Birds: horizontal, will do its 'droppings' as soon as the tentacle? or mouth piece is below the bird.
- Planes: Same as birds will show up in higher altitudes. Droppings are bombs/packets, may also shoot forward?
##### Growth
The more you eat the larger you'll become. This is done by scaling the background and setting a requirement of how much you must eat in order to go to the next stage.
Taking damage will shrink you back down.
#### Secondary
##### Shooting?
#todo Add this to tentacle abilities?
##### Upgrades?
#todo Get to choose offense/defence upgrades?
##### Bosses?
#todo On certain altitudes bosses may appear, being defeated will lower you to a previous altitude?
