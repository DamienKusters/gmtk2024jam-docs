### GMTK theme
The theme: **Built to Scale**
It's a Rubik's cube memory game based on the relative scaling of all object in the scene 
### Game Mechanics
#### Primary
##### Limited swaps?
You may have limited swaps in order to complete the scene.
##### Winning
You win the game if you correctly swapped all sizes of all objects correctly.
##### Scene generation
When starting, the sizes of all objects are procedurally swapped to make it possible to finish the level.<br/>

#### Secondary
##### Zooming in/out?
You may be able to zoom in and out to select objects of a bigger/smaller scale.
- You have a big ant in the scene and a small tree. Those need to be swapped

## Art
Wireframe objects?
3D models to allow for depth and better judgement of sizes?<br/>
Another option is using an orthographic perspective on 2d objects:
